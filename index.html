                <h3>Sales Analysis Project (2017-2020)</h3>
                <p>I analyzed sales data for a hardware company from 2017 to 2020, using MySQL for data extraction and cleaning. I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights, including top customers, products, and markets. The analysis tracked revenue trends, revealing a decline over the period and providing actionable insights for improvement.</p>
